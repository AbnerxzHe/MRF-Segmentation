# MRF-Segmentation
Markov Random field based semantic segmentation implemented as project for Computer Vision (CSE 578) course at IIIT Hyderabad.

To run this code:
1. Place VOC dataset here. See the path used in image_reader.py
2. Place  [VGG16 weights including top](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5'). See the name of the file used in model_final.py file.
Now it is not getting trained. Just showing Epoch 1/20 and stucked there. Don't know why.
