# MRF-Segmentation
Markov Random field based semantic segmentation implemented as project for Computer Vision (CSE 578) course at IIIT Hyderabad.

To run this code:
1. Place VOC dataset here. See the path used in image_reader.py

Train the model with your choice of optimizer, lr, decay etc. Choose a loss method. We can implement our ideas individually and see what works. :smiley:
